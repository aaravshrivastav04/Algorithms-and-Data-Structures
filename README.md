# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures


This repository consists of Python programs where several algorithms and data structures have been used to manipulate it's flow and make it more efficient. It consists of some challenging programs often asked at coding interviews and with whom a developer is generally expected to be familiar with. Thus, for the sake of helping those hard-working developers out there, I have created this repository which consists of well commented solutions to some of the common coding challenges related to algorithms and data structures. Thanks, enjoy!
